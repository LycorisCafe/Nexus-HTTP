/**
 * Mark endpoint method as an HTTP {@code PATCH} request method endpoint. There are a few points that API users should follow.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Annotated method must be {@code public} and {@code static}.</li>
 *     <li>Annotated method must use return type as {@code HttpResponse}.</li>
 *     <li>Annotated method must have two parameters. {@code HttpPatchRequest} and {@code HttpResponse} respectively.</li>
 *     <li>The class holding the annotated method must be annotated with {@code HttpEndpoint}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * When doing the in-method processing, it's recommended to return the same {@code HttpResponse} that got as a method parameter with any changes (for
 * more info, see {@code HttpResponse} class).
 * <pre>
 *     {@code
 *     @PATCH("/samplePatchEndpoint")
 *     public static HttpResponse samplePatchEndpoint(HttpPatchRequest request,
 *                                                    HttpResponse response) {
 *         // ...
 *         return response;
 *     }
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @apiNote Make sure to change the HTTP status code appropriately when returning the {@code HttpResponse}. The default value is {@code 200 OK}.

 * @see HttpStatusCode
